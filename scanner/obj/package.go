// Package obj provides APIs through which one can parse Wavefront OBJ
// resources.
// The OBJ file format is quite common and is used to store 3D model data.
//
// The parsers provided by this library do not support the full OBJ spec,
// which is quite lengthy, but rather only the most essential and common
// features.
