// Package mtl provides APIs through which one can parse Wavefront MTL
// resources.
// The MTL file format is quite common and is used to store material data
// for OBJ 3D models.
//
// The parsers provided by this library do not support the full MTL spec,
// which is quite lengthy, but rather only the most essential and common
// features.
